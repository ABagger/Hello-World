# Hello World!

I use this account to store and share code related to video game 
projects that my friends and I have worked on in the past or
that we are currently working on.

## Super Rocket Patrol
My first project used the phaser 3 game engine and was a remake
of a 1978 game called Rocket Patrol (with some major improvements)
If you'd like to play it or learn more about that project, here are the links
- [Repository](https://github.com/ABagger/Super-Rocket-Patrol/)
- [Game](https://abagger.github.io/Super-Rocket-Patrol/)

## Aliens Love Toast
This is the project that I'm working on currently, and it is very
unfinished (barely started really), but I will add links and pertinent 
info as I make progress on it.
